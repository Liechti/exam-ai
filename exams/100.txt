Which is more valuable? Water or diamonds? Water is more useful to mankind than diamonds, and yet [26] are costlier. Why? Called the diamond-water paradox, this is a classic problem posed to students of economics. The answer has to do with supply and demand. Being a rare natural resource, diamonds are [27] in supply. However, their demand is high because many people buy them to tell the world that they have money, [28] as conspicuous consumption in economics. In other words, the scarcity of goods is [29] causes humans to attribute value. If we [30] surrounded by an unending abundance of diamonds, we probably wouldn’t value them very much. Hence, diamonds carry a higher monetary value than water, even though we find more use for water.

Popcorn is one of the snacks that rarely fail to make watching a movie more fun. However, the modern way of preparing this [31] snack may carry an unhappy secret. Research by the U.S. government now reports that microwave popcorn may contain substances that can cause health [32] . Researchers found that commercial popcorn companies often coat their microwave popcorn bags with a [33] called perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) which has been found to cause both cancer and lung disease in laboratory animals. Making matters worse, the artificial butter substitute that generally [34] with microwavable popcorn contains a common food-flavoring substance. This substance, according to health scientists, is [35] for some serious lung diseases. For an easy and [36] alternative, nutritionists suggest that we pop our own popcorn. All that is [37] is a large, high pot, about four tablespoons of vegetable oil and a small handful of organic popcorn kernels. When the kernels start [38] , shake the pot to let the steam escape and to let the unpopped kernels fall to the bottom. As soon as the popping slows down, [39] the pot from the stove. Then pour the popcorn into a bowl and season with a small [40] of real butter or olive oil and natural salt. And the healthy and fun snack is ready to serve.

  <Q41-to-Q44>
There is a long-held belief that when meeting someone, the more eye contact we have with the person, the better. The result is an unfortunate tendency for people making initial contact- in a job interview, for example- to stare fixedly at the other individual. However, this behavior is likely to make the interviewer feel very uncomfortable. Most of us are comfortable with eye contact lasting a few seconds. But eye contact which persists longer than that can make us nervous. Another widely accepted belief is that powerful people in a society - often men - show their dominance over others by touching them in a variety of ways. In fact, research shows that in almost all cases, lower-status people initiate touch. Women also initiate touch more often than men do. The belief that rapid speech and lying go together is also widespread and enduring. We react strongly - and suspiciously - to fast talk. However, the opposite is a greater cause for suspicion. Speech that is slow, because it is laced with pauses or errors, is a more reliable indicator of lying than the opposite.

It is easy for us to tell our friends from our enemies. But can other animals do the same? Elephants can! They can use their sense of vision and smell to tell the difference between people who pose a threat and those who do not. In Kenya, researchers found that elephants react differently to clothing worn by men of the Maasai and Kamba ethnic groups. Young Maasai men spear animals and thus pose a threat to elephants; Kamba men are mainly farmers and are not a danger to elephants. In an experiment conducted by animal scientists, elephants were first presented with clean clothing or clothing that had been worn for five days by either a Maasai or a Kamba man. When the elephants detected the smell of clothing worn by a Maasai man, they moved away from the smell faster and took longer to relax than when they detected the smells of either clothing worn by Kamba men or clothing that had not been worn at all. Garment color also plays a role, though in a different way. In the same study, when the elephants saw red clothing not worn before, they reacted angrily, as red is typically worn by Maasai men. Rather than running away as they did with the smell, the elephants acted aggressively toward the red clothing. The researchers believe that the elephants'  emotional reactions are due to their different interpretations of the smells and the sights. Smelling a potential danger means that a threat is nearby and the best thing to do is run away and hide. Seeing a potential threat without its smell means that risk is low. Therefore, instead of showing fear and running away, the elephants express their anger and become aggressive.

It was something she had dreamed of since she was five. Finally, after years of training and intensive workouts, Deborah Duffey was going to compete in her first high school basketball game. The goals of becoming an outstanding player and playing college ball were never far from Deborah's mind. The game was against Mills High School. With 1:42 minutes left in the game, Deborah’s team led by one point. A player of Mills had possession of the ball, and Deborah ran to guard against her. As Deborah shuffled sideways to block the player, her knee went out and she collapsed on the court in burning pain. Just like that, Deborah’s season was over. After suffering the bad injury, Deborah found that, for the first time in her life, she was in a situation beyond her control. Game after game, she could do nothing but sit on the sidelines watching others play the game that she loved so much. Injuries limited Deborah's time on the court as she hurt her knees three more times in the next five years. She had to spend countless hours in a physical therapy clinic to receive treatment. Her frequent visits there gave her a passion and respect for the profession. And Deborah began to see a new light in her life. Currently a senior in college, Deborah focuses on pursuing a degree in physical therapy. After she graduates, Deborah plans to use her knowledge to educate people how to best take care of their bodies and cope with the feelings of hopelessness that she remembers so well.

Redwood trees are the tallest plants on the earth, reaching heights of up to 100 meters. They are also known for their longevity, typically 500 to 1000 years, but sometimes more than 2000 years. A hundred million years ago, in the age of dinosaurs, redwoods were common in the forests of a much more moist and tropical North America. As the climate became drier and colder, they retreated to a narrow strip along the Pacific coast of Northern California. The trunk of redwood trees is very stout and usually forms a single straight column. It is covered with a beautiful soft, spongy bark. This bark can be pretty thick, well over two feet in the more mature trees. It gives the older trees a certain kind of protection from insects, but the main benefit is that it keeps the center of the tree intact from moderate forest fires because of its thickness. This fire resistant quality explains why the giant redwood grows to live that long. While most other types of trees are destroyed by forest fires, the giant redwood actually prospers because of them. Moderate fires will clear the ground of competing plant life, and the rising heat dries and opens the ripe cones of the redwood, releasing many thousands of seeds onto the ground below. New trees are often produced from sprouts, little baby trees, which form at the base of the trunk. These sprouts grow slowly, nourished by the root system of the “mother” tree. When the main tree dies, the sprouts are then free to grow as full trees, forming a “fairy ring” of trees around the initial tree. These trees, in turn, may give rise to more sprouts, and the cycle continues.
